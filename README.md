# Raspberry Power Hat: ARCHIVED

This is an older version of the Raspberry power hat, there is a newer version of this board which is currently being used in production and it's fully tested and ready for you to use.

Please go to [https://github.com/bartei/power-board-v2] and use the new version instead.

The new version has less components, better thermals, and a good RS485 interface with proper protection and 3.3v voltage interface for the communication with the Raspberry PI.
